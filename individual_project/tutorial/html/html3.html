          <h1>HTML - Attributes</h1>
          <p>
              We have seen few HTML tags and their usage like heading tags 
              &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, paragraph tag &lt;&gt; and other tags. 
              We used them so far in their simplest form, but most of the 
              HTML tags can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information.
          </p>
          <p>
            An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML 
            element and is placed inside the element's opening tag. All 
            attributes are made up of two parts − a name and a value
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The name is the property you want to set. For example, 
              the paragraph &lt;p> element in the example carries an attribute 
              whose name is align, which you can use to indicate the alignment 
              of paragraph on the page.  
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              The value is what you want the value of the property to be set 
              and always put within quotations. The below example shows three
              possible values of align attribute: left, center and right.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Attribute names and attribute values are case-insensitive. 
            However, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends lowercase 
            attributes/attribute values in their HTML 4 recommendation.
          </p>
          <h2>Core Attributes</h2>
          <p>
              The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of HTML 
              elements (although not all) are −
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Id</li>
            <li>Title</li>
            <li>Class</li>
            <li>Style</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Id Attribute</h3>
          <p>
              The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identify 
              any element within an HTML page. There are two primary reasons 
              that you might want to use an id attribute on an element −</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier, 
              it is possible to identify just that element and its content.</li>
            <li>If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page 
              (or style sheet), you can use the id attribute to distinguish 
              between elements that have the same name.</li>
          </ul>
         <h3>The title Attribute</h3>
         <p>The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element. 
           They syntax for the title attribute is similar as explained for 
           <strong>id</strong> attribute −</p>
         <p>The behavior of this attribute will depend upon the element that 
           carries it, although it is often displayed as a tooltip when cursor 
           comes over the element or while the element is loading.</p>
         <h3>The class Attribute</h3>
         <p>
            The <strong>class</strong> attribute is used to associate an element with a style 
            sheet, and specifies the class of element. You will learn more 
            about the use of the class attribute when you will learn Cascading 
            Style Sheet (CSS). So for now you can avoid it.
         </p>
         <h3>The style Attribute</h3>
         <p>
            The style attribute allows you to specify Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) rules within the element.
         </p>
         <h3>Generic Attributes</h3>
         <p>
            Here's a table of some other attributes that are readily usable with many of the HTML tags.
         </p>
         <table>
           <tr>
             <th>Attribute</th>
             <th>Options</th>
             <th>Function</th>
           </tr>
           <tr>
             <td>align</td>
             <td>right, left, center</td>
             <td>Horizontally aligns tags</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
             <td>bgcolor</td>
             <td>numeric, hexidecimal, RGB values</td>
             <td>Places a background color behind an element</td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
             <td>background</td>
             <td>URL</td>
             <td>Places a background image behind an element</td>
           </tr>
           
         </table>
