            <p class="blocktext">A <del>ghast</del> <ins>ghost</ins>, though invisible, still is like a place <br>
                your sight can knock on, echoing; but here <br>
                within this thick black pelt, your strongest gaze <br>
                will be absorbed and utterly disappear:
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p class="blocktext"> just as a raving madman, when nothing else <br>
                can ease him, charges into his dark night <br>
                howling, pounds on the padded wall, and feels <br>
                the rage being taken in and pacified.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="blocktext">She seems to hide all looks that have ever fallen <br>
                into her, so that, like an audience, <br>
                she can look them over, menacing and sullen, <br>
                and curl to sleep with them. But all at once </p>
            <hr>
            <p class="blocktext">as if awakened, she turns her face to yours; <br>
                and with a shock, you see yourself, tiny, <br>
                inside the golden amber of her eyeballs <br>
                suspended, like a prehistoric fly. </p>
